# Adaptation of TPU-based BERT with TF MirrorredStrategy 

This is a multi-GPU variant of [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) developed by Google. The Google version appears to be written for scaling with TPUs ([tf.contrib.tpu.TPUEstimatorSpec](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/tpu/TPUEstimatorSpec)).
